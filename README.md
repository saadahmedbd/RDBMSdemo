PROECT structure

In this project, I talk about data relations. There are three different kinds of data exits in databases: many-to-many, one-to-many, and one-to-one. In addition, there is a database type that is many-to-one, which is the opposite of one-to-many.Database relation is very important things in our project. It's use multiple place. so let's start.

ONE-TO-ONE

One to one
